/**
 * A class that creates a debounced function.
 *
 * Debouncing ensures that a function is only executed after a certain amount of time has passed
 * since its last invocation. This is useful for handling frequent events like window resizing,
 * scroll events, or input changes where you want to limit the rate of execution.
 *
 * The debounced function can be configured to execute either at the start of the delay period
 * (leading edge) or at the end (trailing edge, default). Each new call during the wait period
 * will reset the timer.
 *
 * State Management:
 * - Uses TanStack Store for reactive state management
 * - Use `initialState` to provide initial state values when creating the debouncer
 * - Use `onExecute` callback to react to function execution and implement custom logic
 * - The state includes canLeadingExecute, execution count, and isPending status
 * - State can be accessed via `debouncer.store.state` when using the class directly
 * - When using framework adapters (React/Solid), state is accessed from `debouncer.state`
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const debouncer = new Debouncer((value: string) => {
 *   saveToDatabase(value);
 * }, { wait: 500 });
 *
 * // Will only save after 500ms of no new input
 * inputElement.addEventListener('input', () => {
 *   debouncer.maybeExecute(inputElement.value);
 * });
 * ```
