/**
 * A class that creates an async rate-limited function.
 *
 * Rate limiting is a simple approach that allows a function to execute up to a limit within a time window,
 * then blocks all subsequent calls until the window passes. This can lead to "bursty" behavior where
 * all executions happen immediately, followed by a complete block.
 *
 * The rate limiter supports two types of windows:
 * - 'fixed': A strict window that resets after the window period. All executions within the window count
 *   towards the limit, and the window resets completely after the period.
 * - 'sliding': A rolling window that allows executions as old ones expire. This provides a more
 *   consistent rate of execution over time.
 *
 * Unlike the non-async RateLimiter, this async version supports returning values from the rate-limited function,
 * making it ideal for API calls and other async operations where you want the result of the `maybeExecute` call
 * instead of setting the result on a state variable from within the rate-limited function.
 *
 * For smoother execution patterns, consider using:
 * - Throttling: Ensures consistent spacing between executions (e.g. max once per 200ms)
 * - Debouncing: Waits for a pause in calls before executing (e.g. after 500ms of no calls)
 *
 * Rate limiting is best used for hard API limits or resource constraints. For UI updates or
 * smoothing out frequent events, throttling or debouncing usually provide better user experience.
 *
 * State Management:
 * - Uses TanStack Store for reactive state management
 * - Use `initialState` to provide initial state values when creating the rate limiter
 * - `initialState` can be a partial state object
 * - Use `onSuccess` callback to react to successful function execution and implement custom logic
 * - Use `onError` callback to react to function execution errors and implement custom error handling
 * - Use `onSettled` callback to react to function execution completion (success or error) and implement custom logic
 * - Use `onReject` callback to react to executions being rejected when rate limit is exceeded
 * - The state includes execution times, success/error counts, and current execution status
 * - State can be accessed via `asyncRateLimiter.store.state` when using the class directly
 * - When using framework adapters (React/Solid), state is accessed from `asyncRateLimiter.state`
 *
 * Error Handling:
 * - If an `onError` handler is provided, it will be called with the error and rate limiter instance
 * - If `throwOnError` is true (default when no onError handler is provided), the error will be thrown
 * - If `throwOnError` is false (default when onError handler is provided), the error will be swallowed
 * - Both onError and throwOnError can be used together - the handler will be called before any error is thrown
 * - The error state can be checked using the underlying AsyncRateLimiter instance
 * - Rate limit rejections (when limit is exceeded) are handled separately from execution errors via the `onReject` handler
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const rateLimiter = new AsyncRateLimiter(
 *   async (id: string) => await api.getData(id),
 *   {
 *     limit: 5,
 *     window: 1000,
 *     windowType: 'sliding',
 *     onError: (error) => {
 *       console.error('API call failed:', error);
 *     },
 *     onReject: (limiter) => {
 *       console.log(`Rate limit exceeded. Try again in ${limiter.getMsUntilNextWindow()}ms`);
 *     }
 *   }
 * );
 *
 * // Will execute immediately until limit reached, then block
 * // Returns the API response directly
 * const data = await rateLimiter.maybeExecute('123');
 * ```
