/**
 * A class that creates a throttled function.
 *
 * Throttling ensures a function is called at most once within a specified time window.
 * Unlike debouncing which waits for a pause in calls, throttling guarantees consistent
 * execution timing regardless of call frequency.
 *
 * Supports both leading and trailing edge execution:
 * - Leading: Execute immediately on first call (default: true)
 * - Trailing: Execute after wait period if called during throttle (default: true)
 *
 * For collapsing rapid-fire events where you only care about the last call, consider using Debouncer.
 *
 * State Management:
 * - Uses TanStack Store for reactive state management
 * - Use `initialState` to provide initial state values when creating the throttler
 * - Use `onExecute` callback to react to function execution and implement custom logic
 * - The state includes execution count, last execution time, pending status, and more
 * - State can be accessed via `throttler.store.state` when using the class directly
 * - When using framework adapters (React/Solid), state is accessed from `throttler.state`
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const throttler = new Throttler(
 *   (id: string) => api.getData(id),
 *   { wait: 1000 } // Execute at most once per second
 * );
 *
 * // First call executes immediately
 * throttler.maybeExecute('123');
 *
 * // Subsequent calls within 1000ms are throttled
 * throttler.maybeExecute('123'); // Throttled
 * ```

 *
 * Throttling ensures a function executes at most once within a specified time window,

 *
 * The throttled function can be configured to execute on the leading and/or trailing
 * edge of the throttle window via options.
 *
 * For handling bursts of events, consider using debounce() instead. For hard execution
 * limits, consider using rateLimit().
 *
 * State Management:

 * - Use `onExecute` callback to react to function execution and implement custom logic
 * - The state includes execution count, last execution time, pending status, and more
 * - State can be accessed via the underlying Throttler instance's `store.state` property
 * - When using framework adapters (React/Solid), state is accessed from the hook's state property
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * // Basic throttling - max once per second
 * const throttled = throttle(updateUI, { wait: 1000 });
 *
 * // Configure leading/trailing execution
 * const throttled = throttle(saveData, {
 *   wait: 2000,
 *   leading: true,  // Execute immediately on first call
 *   trailing: true  // Execute again after delay if called during wait
