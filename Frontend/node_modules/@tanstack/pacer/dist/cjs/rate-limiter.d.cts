/**
 * A class that creates a rate-limited function.
 *
 * Rate limiting is a simple approach that allows a function to execute up to a limit within a time window,
 * then blocks all subsequent calls until the window passes. This can lead to "bursty" behavior where
 * all executions happen immediately, followed by a complete block.
 *
 * The rate limiter supports two types of windows:
 * - 'fixed': A strict window that resets after the window period. All executions within the window count
 *   towards the limit, and the window resets completely after the period.
 * - 'sliding': A rolling window that allows executions as old ones expire. This provides a more
 *   consistent rate of execution over time.
 *
 * For smoother execution patterns, consider using:
 * - Throttling: Ensures consistent spacing between executions (e.g. max once per 200ms)
 * - Debouncing: Waits for a pause in calls before executing (e.g. after 500ms of no calls)
 *
 * Rate limiting is best used for hard API limits or resource constraints. For UI updates or
 * smoothing out frequent events, throttling or debouncing usually provide better user experience.
 *
 * State Management:
 * - Uses TanStack Store for reactive state management
 * - Use `initialState` to provide initial state values when creating the rate limiter
 * - Use `onExecute` callback to react to function execution and implement custom logic
 * - Use `onReject` callback to react to executions being rejected when rate limit is exceeded
 * - The state includes execution count, execution times, and rejection count
 * - State can be accessed via `rateLimiter.store.state` when using the class directly
 * - When using framework adapters (React/Solid), state is accessed from `rateLimiter.state`
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const rateLimiter = new RateLimiter(
 *   (id: string) => api.getData(id),
 *   {
 *     limit: 5,
 *     window: 1000,
 *     windowType: 'sliding',
 *   }
 * );
 *
 * // Will execute immediately until limit reached, then block
 * rateLimiter.maybeExecute('123');
 * ```

/**
 * Creates a rate-limited function that will execute the provided function up to a maximum number of times within a time window.
 *
 * Note that rate limiting is a simpler form of execution control compared to throttling or debouncing:
 * - A rate limiter will allow all executions until the limit is reached, then block all subsequent calls until the window resets
 * - A throttler ensures even spacing between executions, which can be better for consistent performance
 * - A debouncer collapses multiple calls into one, which is better for handling bursts of events
 *
 * The rate limiter supports two types of windows:
 * - 'fixed': A strict window that resets after the window period. All executions within the window count
 *   towards the limit, and the window resets completely after the period.
 * - 'sliding': A rolling window that allows executions as old ones expire. This provides a more
 *   consistent rate of execution over time.
 *
 * State Management:
 * - Uses TanStack Store for reactive state management
 * - Use `initialState` to provide initial state values when creating the rate limiter
 * - Use `onExecute` callback to react to function execution and implement custom logic
 * - Use `onReject` callback to react to executions being rejected when rate limit is exceeded
 * - The state includes execution count, execution times, and rejection count
 * - State can be accessed via the underlying RateLimiter instance's `store.state` property
 * - When using framework adapters (React/Solid), state is accessed from the hook's state property
 *
 * Consider using throttle() or debounce() if you need more intelligent execution control. Use rate limiting when you specifically
 * need to enforce a hard limit on the number of executions within a time period.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * // Rate limit to 5 calls per minute with a sliding window
 * const rateLimited = rateLimit(makeApiCall, {
 *   limit: 5,
 *   window: 60000,
 *   windowType: 'sliding',
 *   onReject: (rateLimiter) => {
 *     console.log(`Rate limit exceeded. Try again in ${rateLimiter.getMsUntilNextWindow()}ms`);
 *   }
 * });
 *
 * // First 5 calls will execute immediately
 * // Additional calls will be rejected until the minute window resets
 * rateLimited();
 *
 * // For more even execution, consider using throttle instead:
 * const throttled = throttle(makeApiCall, { wait: 12000 }); // One call every 12 seconds
 * ```
