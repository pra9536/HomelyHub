/**
 * A class that creates an async throttled function.
 *
 * Throttling limits how often a function can be executed, allowing only one execution within a specified time window.
 * Unlike debouncing which resets the delay timer on each call, throttling ensures the function executes at a
 * regular interval regardless of how often it's called.
 *
 * Unlike the non-async Throttler, this async version supports returning values from the throttled function,
 * making it ideal for API calls and other async operations where you want the result of the `maybeExecute` call
 * instead of setting the result on a state variable from within the throttled function.
 *
 * This is useful for rate-limiting API calls, handling scroll/resize events, or any scenario where you want to
 * ensure a maximum execution frequency.
 *
 * Error Handling:
 * - If an `onError` handler is provided, it will be called with the error and throttler instance
 * - If `throwOnError` is true (default when no onError handler is provided), the error will be thrown
 * - If `throwOnError` is false (default when onError handler is provided), the error will be swallowed
 * - Both onError and throwOnError can be used together - the handler will be called before any error is thrown
 * - The error state can be checked using the underlying AsyncThrottler instance
 *
 * State Management:
 * - Uses TanStack Store for reactive state management
 * - Use `initialState` to provide initial state values when creating the async throttler
 * - Use `onSuccess` callback to react to successful function execution and implement custom logic
 * - Use `onError` callback to react to function execution errors and implement custom error handling
 * - Use `onSettled` callback to react to function execution completion (success or error) and implement custom logic
 * - The state includes error count, execution status, last execution time, and success/settle counts
 * - State can be accessed via `asyncThrottler.store.state` when using the class directly
 * - When using framework adapters (React/Solid), state is accessed from `asyncThrottler.state`
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const throttler = new AsyncThrottler(async (value: string) => {
 *   const result = await saveToAPI(value);
 *   return result; // Return value is preserved
 * }, {
 *   wait: 1000,
 *   onError: (error) => {
 *     console.error('API call failed:', error);
 *   }
 * });
 *
 * // Will only execute once per second no matter how often called
 * // Returns the API response directly
 * const result = await throttler.maybeExecute(inputElement.value);
 * ```
