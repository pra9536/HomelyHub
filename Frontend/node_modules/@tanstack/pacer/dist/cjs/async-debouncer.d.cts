/**
 * A class that creates an async debounced function.
 *
 * Debouncing ensures that a function is only executed after a specified delay has passed since its last invocation.
 * Each new invocation resets the delay timer. This is useful for handling frequent events like window resizing
 * or input changes where you only want to execute the handler after the events have stopped occurring.
 *
 * Unlike throttling which allows execution at regular intervals, debouncing prevents any execution until
 * the function stops being called for the specified delay period.
 *
 * Unlike the non-async Debouncer, this async version supports returning values from the debounced function,
 * making it ideal for API calls and other async operations where you want the result of the `maybeExecute` call
 * instead of setting the result on a state variable from within the debounced function.
 *
 * Error Handling:
 * - If an `onError` handler is provided, it will be called with the error and debouncer instance
 * - If `throwOnError` is true (default when no onError handler is provided), the error will be thrown
 * - If `throwOnError` is false (default when onError handler is provided), the error will be swallowed
 * - Both onError and throwOnError can be used together - the handler will be called before any error is thrown
 * - The error state can be checked using the underlying store
 *
 * State Management:
 * - The debouncer uses a reactive store for state management
 * - Use `initialState` to provide initial state values when creating the async debouncer
 * - The state includes canLeadingExecute, error count, execution status, and success/settle counts
 * - State can be accessed via the `store` property and its `state` getter
 * - The store is reactive and will notify subscribers of state changes
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const asyncDebouncer = new AsyncDebouncer(async (value: string) => {
 *   const results = await searchAPI(value);
 *   return results; // Return value is preserved
 * }, {
 *   wait: 500,
 *   onError: (error) => {
 *     console.error('Search failed:', error);
 *   }
 * });
 *
 * // Called on each keystroke but only executes after 500ms of no typing
 * // Returns the API response directly
 * const results = await asyncDebouncer.maybeExecute(inputElement.value);
 * ```

 * - Use `onSettled` callback to react to function execution completion (success or error) and implement custom logic
 * - The state includes canLeadingExecute, error count, execution status, and success/settle counts
 * - State can be accessed via `asyncDebouncer.store.state` when using the class directly
 * - When using framework adapters (React/Solid), state is accessed from `asyncDebouncer.state`

 * ```ts
 * const debounced = asyncDebounce(async (value: string) => {
